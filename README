JASG - Readme

The JastAdd Specification Generator Framework (JASG) consists of a set of tools 
that facilitate the generation of JastAdd module documentation and the creation 
of new module features.

The documentation generator program creates an API of the scanner and parser 
rules of the modules. 

The XML parser program parses a JASG XML specification and generates a set of
JastAdd specification files such as parser, scanner, and AST and AST behavior
specifications.

The structure of the JASG XML is described in the jasg.dtd file.

The creates files are stored in a "custom" directory.
A namespace is given to group different types of files in a 
same directory.

Different templates can be used to use different specifcations tools.
For example, the default scanner tools is jflex. JASG provides a 
jflex template (JFlexDocumentFactory.java) that constructs a jflex
specification file. Other templates can be created such as flex template
that extends the ScannerFactory.java.

The default parser template is beaver.

The framework can be used to create a skeleton of a project with
empty files, partial files, or complete specifications.

NOTES:
- Future work includes identifying necessary AST behavior specifications, 
  such as AST attributes and rewrites, for given AST definitons.
- Also a GUI is in development to help in the creation of a JASG XML
  specification file.
