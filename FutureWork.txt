Future work:

- Change name of elements in jast.dtd to make it consistent (e.g. se_, pe_, etc)
- Use properties for template classes (e.g. BeaverParserFactory)
- GUI support
- Generating neccessary JastAdd attributes to implement in 
	aspects (currently RagDoll is enough to learn about
	needed attributes)
